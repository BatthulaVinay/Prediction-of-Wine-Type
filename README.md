# Prediction-of-Wine-Type
# Prediction of Wine Type using Deep Learning

This project uses deep learning to classify different types of wine based on their characteristics. The model is trained on a dataset containing various wine attributes and predicts the type of wine.

## 📌 Features
- Implements a deep learning model for wine classification
- Uses Python and TensorFlow/Keras for training
- Supports dataset preprocessing and model evaluation
- Provides visualization of results

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required dependencies using:
(*If `requirements.txt` is missing, install the libraries manually as listed in the Jupyter Notebook.*)

## 📂 Dataset
Ensure you have the dataset in the correct location. If it is a public dataset, download it from the appropriate source.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
2. Run `Prediction of Wine type using Deep Learning.ipynb`.
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

## 📊 Model Performance
- The model is evaluated based on accuracy and loss metrics.
- Visualization of training and validation performance is included.
